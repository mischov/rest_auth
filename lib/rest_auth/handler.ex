  The primary behaviour that drives the use of `RestAuth` in a project.
  """

  @doc """
  Used to load user from a data store.

  Primary use case is in `RestAuth.Controller.login/2`. Must return a
  `RestAuth.Authority` struct with all the relevant user information.

  Beware that while `metadata` can be anything it must be serializeable by
  `Poison` JSON encoder. This can be solved by using the standard types like List,
  Map etc or by implementing the `Poison` protocol.

  Do note that all the data returned here will be embedded in the token,
  so try to keep it as small as possible.

  The `:error` reason should be a string explaining why the user was not returned.
  Some examples

    * "Wrong username and/or password."
    * "Account is locked"
    * "Account has not been activated yet".
    * "Error connecting to database."

  already known user. It is also used in `RestAuth.Test.authenticate_conn/2`.

  a version field this function can return the authority in a
  `{:client_outdated, RestAuth.Authority.t}` tuple.
